# MeanStack
This repository is a very bare-bones example of a full MEAN javascript stack website using no additional frameworks (that aren't already dependencies of the included frameworks).

[M]ongoDb<br />
[E]xpressJS<br />
[A]ngularJS<br />
[N]odeJS


Setup:<br />
npm install

In mongo console:<br />
Use mean<br />
db.content.insert({header: "Hello, World!"})<br />

Ensure that mongod is running on port 27017 (should be default)
